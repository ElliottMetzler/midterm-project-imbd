## Exploratory Data Analysis

## Modeling Analysis

## Conclusions

Need to include here a summary of:
* Goal of analysis and conclusions
* limitations of the project
* Areas where we would have improved or expanded the project if we had more time

## Instructions to reproduce Analysis:

1) Set-up Instructions:
	* Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

2) Data Scrape and Clean Instructions:
	* Run `python3 code/imdb_scraper.py` to scrape the data from the imdb website. This script will navigate to the imdb pages and scrape the data, generating a csv file of raw data in the raw data folder. The output is `data/raw/imdb_scraped.csv`
	* Run `python3 code/imdb_cleaner.py` to clean the raw imdb data. This file takes in the csv generated by the prior script and cleans it using pandas. The output is `data/clean/imdb_clean.csv`

3) Instructions to Produce Figures:
